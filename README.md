# 📧 Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning 🚀

**Welcome to my email spam detection project!** This repository showcases a high-quality, beginner-friendly implementation of an email spam detection system using machine learning. Built as part of my internship at **Oasis Infobyte (2025)**, this project highlights my skills in data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## 🔍 Overview

This project uses a **Logistic Regression** model to classify email messages as **spam** or **ham (not spam)**. It utilizes:
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** to transform text into numerical features
- **Data Preprocessing** to clean and encode labels
- **Model Evaluation** to assess performance using accuracy and a classification report.
